# MarioKart8-Gym-Env
A MarioKart8 OpenAI Gym environment for reinforcement learning projects.

# Coming soon
This project was completed on 03/2023 as a personal project first. I managed to train an agent that beat the hardest CPU in a few hundred hours of play (ingame time).

Now, I'll try to publish an easy-to-read and reproducible version of this project with the aim of serving as an example of "HowTo" transform Switch games into a Gym environment for RL applications.

The agent will be published in other repository.
